# commitBot
commitBot is a tool that automates committing and pushing files to a user's GitHub repository at a specified interval. When no specific file path is provided, the bot will upload and then delete a README file to help maintain a consistent GitHub streak.

## Applications
- Gradual project file commits: Allows users to commit and push files from a project incrementally at their preferred intervals.
- Maintaining GitHub streaks: Helps users keep their GitHub streak alive by automatically pushing and deleting a README file.
